# verse

This project is a game to write text together, poetry or prose or whatever.
Create a room, send the link to your friend or wait for the stranger. First line is always hard, but be tactful: every last word of your line is the first word of next person's saying. You won't see the full work before publish.
Like in a Chinese whispers game, oh, what tender stanzas will you get.
